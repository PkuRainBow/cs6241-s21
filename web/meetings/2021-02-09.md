Welcome to the class!

We spent the first 25 minutes or so walking through course logistics
and the topics covered in the course.  We then turned to a discussion
of different linear algebraic objects represented by matrices (linear
maps, operators, bilinear and sesquilinear forms, quadratic forms), and the
associated canonical forms.  The discussion was mostly mathematical,
though with a few notes on how these concepts arise in data science
applications.

The first lecture involved more logistics than normal.  Future lectures
will generally involve a five-minute icebreaker / quiz / warm-up at
the beginning and 15-20 minutes of group work at the end.
